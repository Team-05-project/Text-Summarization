# Overview
This project delves into Natural Language Processing (NLP), showcasing practical implementations of key techniques used in text analysis and language modeling. It is designed to serve as a resource for students and researchers looking to understand or apply NLP concepts.
## Features

- **File Processing and Structuring:**
  - Automatically traverses a directory of text files and organizes them into a structured format using Python.
  - Extracts metadata such as file paths, categories, and content types (articles or summaries).

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Processes and categorizes text data into meaningful categories.
  - Calculates the distribution of articles across categories.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilizes `plotly` and `cufflinks` for creating interactive and insightful visualizations, including:
    - **Bar Charts:** Displaying the number of articles per category.
    - **Box Plots:** Analyzing the size distribution of categories.
    - **Bubble Charts:** Highlighting coverage ratios for different categories.

- **Flexible Data Handling:**
  - Allows for easy customization of directory paths and categorization rules.
  - Outputs a clean and well-structured DataFrame for further analysis.

- **Reproducibility:**
  - Provides a Jupyter Notebook format for seamless integration, testing, and demonstration of concepts.

- **Ease of Use:**
  - Simple setup with detailed instructions for running the notebook and interpreting the results.

# Prerequisites
To work with this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or above.

- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running the notebook.

- Required Python libraries (install using requirements.txt, if included).
